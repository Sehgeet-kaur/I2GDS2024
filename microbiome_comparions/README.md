##Comparative Overview of Microbiome Analysis Pipelines

Microbiome studies have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world and its impact on ecosystems, health, and disease. The advent of advanced sequencing technologies has dramatically expanded our ability to explore and characterize microbial communities. However, the diversity of available bioinformatics tools and workflows can often be overwhelming, leading to challenges in selecting the appropriate pipeline for specific research goals. This is a comparative analysis of microbiome analysis pipelines, tailored to both **short-read** and **long-read** sequencing technologies.
